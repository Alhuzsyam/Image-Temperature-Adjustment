# Image-Temperature-Adjustment

This application is designed for manipulating images, particularly with image filters. Its main feature is the ability to adjust the image from warm to cold mode. I've implemented it using JavaScript as the tech stack. You can clone the app to your local computer without any configuration required.
The application has three buttons: the first button is for uploading images, the second button is for resetting the filter settings, and the last button is for saving the image.
Please note that the application only supports JPEG images, and the output is also in JPEG format. If you upload any other format besides JPEG, the process will be rejected.

Here is the result :)
